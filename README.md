# Complete Authentication System Using DRF(django-rest-framework) and React-JS Via API

This is the Complete Frontend and Backend mini project where you can learn more about authentication system as how it works and basic api building and fetching.
I have used react-redux RTK Query for api fetching and made authentication more secure using `simple_jwt` hope you like it....

    `npm start`



2. For Backend go to the `jwt_login_auth`folder mention above and simply open integrated terminal  inside this folder run following command
